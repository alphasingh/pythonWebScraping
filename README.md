# pythonWebScraping
Python snippets to scrap web endpoints

# Requirements
1. python3
2. pip3 (to install dependencies)

# system
Works best in GNU/Linux environment (can work otherwise with some tweaks here and there)

# import
All the libraries mentioned in the starting of the code

# automation
1. scheduler is being used to schedule the job every one minute, change to suit your needs
2. Instead of winsound, print('\a') works best for Linux as sound of default alert bell.
Optional: can be scheduled via cron job (preferrable, as this will continuously need CPU resources until price match is found)
